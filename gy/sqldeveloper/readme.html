            <p>Oracle SQL Developer 3.0 introduces the following key functionality:</p>
            
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Data Miner: </strong>A new SQL Developer extension, Oracle 
            Data Miner is the graphical user interface for Oracle Data Mining, 
            an option to the Oracle Database Enterprise Edition. Oracle Data Mining 
            provides in-database functionality that enables users to discover 
            patterns and relationships hidden in their data to predict customer 
            behavior, identify key factors, find new clusters and their profiles, 
            anticipate and combat churn, detect anomalous behavior and solve a 
            wide range of data-driven problems. For more information, visit <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/options/odm/index.html">Oracle 
            Data Miner on OTN</a>.</li>
          <li><strong>Data Modeler:</strong> SQL Developer Data Modeler 3.0 is 
            now fully integrated, providing read and write access for designing 
            and developing data models. The readme.html for SQL Developer Data 
            Modeler 3.0 can be found in the SQL Developer installation in the 
            folder \sqldeveloper\sqldeveloper\extensions\oracle.datamodeler.</li>
          <li><strong>Exporting and Importing:</strong> The Importing and Exporting 
            wizards have been updated to support a wider range of choices. During 
            the early adopter release cycle Export was renamed to Unload and Import 
            to Load. Following user feedback, we have reverted to the original 
            terms of Import and Export. You'll find these on the <strong>Tools 
            &gt; Database Export</strong> menu, and <strong>Export...</strong> 
            on the context menus for Tables and Views and on Data Grids. Import 
            Data is available on table context menus.</li>
          <li><strong>Database Navigator:</strong> Users can now manage Database 
            Configuration files, Resource consumption, Security for profiles, 
            roles and users, and manage Storage files such as control files, datafiles, 
            archive and redo logs, rollback segments and tablespaces.</li>
          <li><strong>DBMS Scheduler:</strong> The Scheduler enables you to control 
            when and where various computing tasks take place in the enterprise 
            environment. The Scheduler helps you effectively manage and plan these 
            tasks. Scheduler objects include: programs, schedules, jobs and job 
            classes, destinations, chains and credentials are now added to the 
            Connections Navigator. A graphical editor called the Scheduler Design 
            Editor can be used to create and run scheduler objects.</li>
          <li><strong>SQL Tuning:</strong> SQL Tuning Advisor analyzes high-volume 
            SQL statement and offers tuning recommendations. A Diff Tool for Explain 
            Plans compares selected Explain Plan or Autotrace results for any 
            SQL statements.</li>
          <li><strong>Query Builder:</strong> Visual SQL Query Builder with an 
            object drag and drop feature from the connection navigator to the 
            Query Builder view. SQL Worksheet and Query Builder view are tightly 
            integrated. Switch between Worksheet (text) and Query Builder (visual) 
            views at any time.</li>
          <li><strong>Spatial Data Management:</strong> Spatial Data Management 
            provides a SQL schema and functions that facilitate the storage, retrieval, 
            update, and query of collections of spatial features in an Oracle 
            database.</li>
          <li><strong>Schema Browser:</strong> The Schema Browser supports fast 
            client-side name based filtering for narrowing the list of objects 
            displayed.</li>
          <li><strong>Migrations: </strong>SQL Developer 3.0 brings a number of 
            new features that support the migration from non-Oracle to the Oracle 
            Database. A significant change is the concept of the Migration Project, 
            a new navigator that holds all the servers in a project all together, 
            which means that users can run several projects together, but report 
            centrally on any one of them at any time with detailed information. 
            The Enterprise Capture allows the user to point at a server and capture 
            all the databases in that server. A number of different estimation 
            reports provide detail on the high level object and error summaries, 
            detailed errors and detailed comparison between source objects, capture 
            and converted objects and the new Oracle objects. The Copy to Oracle 
            feature allows users to copy tables and procedures from third parties 
            into an Oracle schema, without a migration repository.</li>
        </ul>
            <p>For a comprehensive list of new features, refer to the <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/developer-tools/sql-developer/rel3-featurelist-ea-189447.html">3.0 New Features</a> page on OTN.</p>

                        <li>On Linux systems, source the shell script TimesTen_install_dir/bin/ttenv.csh or TimesTen_install_dir/bin/ttenv.sh to set up the TimesTen environment variables before launching SQL Developer. On Windows, use the TimesTen_install_dir\bin\ttenv.bat script.</li>
                        <li>Make sure the CLASSPATH environment variable is pointing to the TimesTen JDBC driver (TimesTen_install_dir/lib/ttjdbc6.jar).</li>
